# Simulate minting NFTs using the Jackpot winnings
# 50% of the mystery box balance to be minting
# 50k - 100k tokens
# 50% of the public tokens balance to be used to mint the NFT (by the end of 33rd journey)
# Assume, public winners of the lottery are going to prune the winnings and dump into the market.
# By the end of 33rd journey 20% NFTs would have been destroyed randomly and the winnings would have been taken out by the public (user who breaks the NFT)
# Users should be able to scrape the lottery from the winnings of evil address and back into the jackpot.

Now I need more, here's the requirements:
- The public supply is with normal users, so they will mint NFTs using the Dark tokens or sell their dark tokens.
- Lottery won by evil address will also be used for minting NFTs in next n values.
- 50% of the mystery boxy balance will be used for minting NFTs.
- 10% of the NFTs will be burned in each nth iteration.
